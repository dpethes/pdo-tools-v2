# pdo-tools-v2
PDO tools extracts and converts data from the PDO format used by Pepakura Designer 1.x.
This version currently doesn't support the format used in Designer 2/3.

TODO

* publish the compression library used in exports in separate repository
* publish the ported exports in this repository
* merge v2 and v3 codebases
